Act Now
-------

Countless times each day we are faced with the question of "what will I do 
now?". Whether the question comes up when you have 10 minutes to kill waiting 
for the bus, or early on a Saturday morning with a whole day ahead of you, this 
question can be difficult to answer. Household chores, personal and work 
projects, social obligations and more all compete for our time and attention,
and existing time-management aren't flexible enough to keep up with a
the pace of modern life.

Rather than re-invent the calendar, _Act Now_ focuses on two things: entering
new actions, and viewing possible next actions. Entering new actions can be
as simple as adding a one-sentance description or title of what you'd like to
do, and viewing next actions likewise presents you with a simple, ordered list.

It is behind the scenes where _Act Now_ really shines. Rather than requiring you
to manually sort and schedule upcoming actions, _Act Now_ attempts to 
automatically sort and filter your action list based on an action's time 
estimate, type, or other criteria. Ideally, you simply dump your ideas into the
system, and when you have some free time ask it for smart, relevant 
recommendations.
